## Criteria for tool inclusion

For a script to get added to this repo, it must enable a smooth user experience for a use case that was otherwise ad-hoc and less comfortable.

## Spec process

For a spec to get included in this repo, it must have at least one implementation, and any outstanding reasonable objections must be addressed. (Sufficiently misleading naming, or even insufficienty leading naming, counts as a reason.)
